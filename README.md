## Problem Statement:
This is a Machine learning project. In this project I am trying to predict the fare of flights by training the dataset which contain data for one year. 

## Approach:

## Data Preprocessing:
In this section I am doing all the Data cleaning and analysis.Most of the data is in categorical form which should get converted into numerical form. 

I did some feature engineering in it and created columns of day and months.There are many columns which i created from the existing column which you can see in the notebook.

I dropped the additional info and route columns as most of the values were missing or of no use.

Here is the comparision graph of Airline vs the price.
